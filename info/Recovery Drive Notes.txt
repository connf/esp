This installation media was created using:
 - Create a Recovery Drive (Windows built in software)
 - Ticked to select 'include System Files'

Built from machine:
SP6 i7 Intel 620 16GB 512GB
Unlicense Windows 10 Home (as it was missold, should be Pro)
Converted to KMS (Assume infected and unclean due to lack of security!)




This is only for testing from USB reset
---------------------------------------
 OOBE changes saved? ensure language, keyboard and format is correct and
  only contains working en-gb UK (and en-us US?) otherwise tweak to liking
  and retest.
 Start menu changes - non important items are removed?

Also check activation status - Activated? Home? Pro (using gen key)? KMS?
 Digital?
 If Pro on genuine then Reset using genuine MS Factory Reset, then create
 rec media and update unattend/oobe configs to match this test to have a
 Custom Genuine Pro Factory Reset USB for SP6 (legal as this i what was
 bought anyway)

Upon confirmation of SP6 Pro Genuine then factory reset using MS SP6 Images
 to guarantee CLEAN system, before creating CLEAN media via same "Recovery
 Drive" software (after updating to genuine Pro)
 Repeat steps to ensure usb media is configured correctly
 This can then be used instead of MS Factory reset to get genuine, more recent
  updates and features of SP6 Win10Pro when needing a full factory reset

Backup a clone of the original MS Repair Media (Download and USB config and
 WinRe partition?)
Backup a clone of the custom genuine SP6 Pro Repair Media if possible

Proceed to modifying the build

Sideload apps and settings and only then create Recovery media (except to get
 the Pro Factory Reset image
